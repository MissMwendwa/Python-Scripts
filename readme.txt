I have done all the questions to the best of my capability
Kindly review question 6 the pi finding code saved as Pi_values.py. 
My understanding of what the question requires might be different from what you expect.
Otherwise I have debugged all the codes and each script is working.
You can do a test drive on your computer by running the files.
